</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that outputs the current shape of the volume associated with a particle as a rotated ellipsoid.
It is only meaningful for particles which interact according to the Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf">this PDF guide</A> to use Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-particle vector of vectors, which can be
accessed by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input. See
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">How-to discussions, section 6.15</A>
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.
</P>
<P>The per-particle vector has 7 entries. The first three entries correspond to the lengths of the ellipsoid's axes and have units of length.
These axis valus are computed as the contact radius times the xx, yy, or zz components of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor associated with the particle.
The next 4 values are quaternions (order: q, x, y, z) which describe the spatial rotation of the particle relative to its initial state.    
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS was
built with that package. See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
</P>
<P>This quantity will be computed only for particles which interact with the Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.
