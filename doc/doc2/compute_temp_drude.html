<H3>compute temp/drude command

<PRE>compute ID group-ID temp/drude 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command

<PRE>compute TDRUDE all temp/drude 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the temperatures of core-Drude
pairs.  This compute is designed to be used with the thermalized Drude
oscillator model.  This compute is designed to be used with the
<A HREF = "tutorial_drude.html">thermalized Drude oscillator model</A>.  Polarizable
models in LAMMPS are described in <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_25">this
Section</A>.
</P>
<P>Drude oscillators consist of a core particle and a Drude particle
connected by a harmonic bond, and the relative motion of these Drude
oscillators is usually maintained cold by a specific thermostat that
acts on the relative motion of the core-Drude particle
pairs. Therefore, because LAMMPS considers Drude particles as normal
atoms in its default temperature compute (<A HREF = "compute_temp.html">compute
temp</A> command), the reduced temperature of the
core-Drude particle pairs is not calculated correctly.
</P>
<P>By contrast, this compute calculates the temperature of the cores
using center-of-mass velocities of the core-Drude pairs, and the
reduced temperature of the Drude particles using the relative
velocities of the Drude particles with respect to their cores.
Non-polarizable atoms are considered as cores.  Their velocities
contribute to the temperature of the cores.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global scalar (the temperature) and a global
vector of length 6, which can be accessed by indices 1-6, whose components
are
</P>
<OL><LI>temperature of the centers of mass (temperature units)
<LI>temperature of the dipoles (temperature units)
<LI>number of degrees of freedom of the centers of mass
<LI>number of degrees of freedom of the dipoles
<LI>kinetic energy of the centers of mass (energy units)
<LI>kinetic energy of the dipoles (energy units) 
</OL>
<P>These values can be used by any command that uses global scalar or
vector values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">this
section</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.
</P>
<P>Both the scalar value and the first two values of the vector
calculated by this compute are "intensive".  The other 4 vector values
are "extensive".
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The number of degrees of freedom contributing to the temperature is
assumed to be constant for the duration of the run unless the 
<I>fix_modify</I> command sets the option <I>dynamic yes</I>.
