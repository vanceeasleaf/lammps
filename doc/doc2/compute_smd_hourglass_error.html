<PRE>compute ID group-ID smd/hourglass_error 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>smd/hourglass_error = style name of this compute command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>compute 1 all smd/hourglass_error 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation which outputs the error of the approximated
relative separation with respect to the actual relative separation of
the particles i and j. Ideally, if the deformation gradient is exact,
and there exists a unique mapping between all particles' positions
within the neighborhood of the central node and the deformation gradient,
the approximated relative separation will coincide with the actual relative
separation of the particles i and j in the deformed configuration.
This compute is only really useful for debugging the hourglass control mechanim which is part of the Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.

<P>See <A HREF = "USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf">this PDF guide</A> to use Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.
</P>
<P><B>Output Info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.  See
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">How-to discussions, section 6.15</A>
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.
</P>
<P>The per-particle vector values will are dimensionless. See <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
</P>
<P>This quantity will be computed only for particles which interact with tlsph pair style.
