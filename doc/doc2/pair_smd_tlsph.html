<H3>pair_style smd/tlsph command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style smd/tlsph args 
</PRE>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>pair_style smd/tlsph
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>smd/tlsph</I> style computes particle interactions according to continuum mechanics constitutive laws and a Total-Lagrangian Smooth-Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm.
</P>
<P>This pair style is invoked with the following command:
</P>
<PRE>pair_style smd/tlsph
pair_coeff i j *COMMON rho0 E nu Q1 Q2 hg Cp &
               *END 
</PRE>
<P>Here, <I>i</I> and <I>j</I> denote the <I>LAMMPS</I> particle types for which this pair style is
defined. Note that <I>i</I> and <I>j</I> must be equal, i.e., no <I>tlsph</I> cross interactions
between different particle types are allowed.
In contrast to the usual <I>LAMMPS</I> <I>pair coeff</I> definitions, which are given solely a
number of floats and integers, the <I>tlsph</I> <I>pair coeff</I> definition is organised using
keywords. These keywords mark the beginning of different sets of parameters for particle properties,
material constitutive models, and damage models. The <I>pair coeff</I> line must be terminated with
the <I>*END</I> keyword. The use the line continuation operator <I>&</I> is recommended. A typical
invocation of the <I>tlsph</I> for a solid body would consist of an equation of state for computing
the pressure (the diagonal components of the stress tensor), and a material model to compute shear
stresses (the off-diagonal components of the stress tensor). Damage and failure models can also be added.
</P>
<P>Please see the <A HREF = "USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf">SMD user guide</A> for a complete listing of the possible keywords and material models.

<P><B>Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info</B>:
</P>
<P>No mixing is performed automatically.
Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization.
rRESPA does not apply to this pair style.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
