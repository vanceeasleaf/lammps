<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix creates reads a traingulated surface from a file in .STL format.
For each triangle, a new particle is created which stores the barycenter of the triangle and the vertex positions.
The radius of the new particle is that of the minimum circle which encompasses the triangle vertices.  
</P>
<P>The triangulated surface can be used as a complex rigid wall via the <A HREF = "pair_smd_triangulated_surface.html">smd/tri_surface</A> pair style.
It is possible to move the triangulated surface via the <A HREF = "fix_smd_move_triangulated_surface.html">smd/move_tri_surf</A> fix style.
</P>
<P>Immediately after a .STL file has been read, the simulation needs to be run for 0 timesteps in order to properly register the new particles
in the system. See the "funnel_flow" example in the USER-SMD examples directory. 
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf">this PDF guide</A> to use Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization. This fix has no outputs.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info. The molecule ID given to the particles created by this fix have to be equal to or larger than 65535.
</P>
<P>Within each .STL file, only a single triangulated object must be present, even though the STL format allows for the possibility of multiple objects in one file.
